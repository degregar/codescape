## Architecture Evolution

### Major Architectural Shift

**From**: Simple web-based RPG with organic code generation
**To**: VSCode extension ecosystem with modular community contributions

### Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Comprehensive sandbox preventing system damage
2. **Better Collaboration**: Git-based workflow for community modules
3. **Professional Integration**: Native VSCode extension with developer tools
4. **Scalable Architecture**: MCP servers for distributed game data
5. **Community Focus**: Easy contribution and sharing of game content

### New Patterns Established

- **Extension-Native UI**: React components in VSCode webviews
- **MCP Server Architecture**: External data sources for game content
- **Module Validation Pipeline**: Automated security and quality checks
- **Developer Transparency**: Real-time display of all Cline operations
- **Community Contribution**: GitHub-based module sharing workflow

## Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies Confirmed

- **TypeScript 5.0+**: Type safety across all modules
- **VSCode Extension API**: Native integration with development environment
- **React 18**: Modern UI framework for game interface
- **SQLite3**: Embedded database for local state persistence
- **Model Context Protocol**: External game data servers
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for extension and servers

### Security Framework

- **Command Whitelisting**: Only safe operations allowed
- **Path Restrictions**: File operations limited to game directory
- **Module Sandboxing**: Community code runs in isolated environment
- **Operation Validation**: All Cline commands checked before execution
- **Audit Logging**: Complete record of all system interactions

## Success Metrics

### Development Phase Success

- **Extension Activation**: VSCode extension loads and activates correctly
- **UI Responsiveness**: React panels render without performance issues
- **Security Validation**: All dangerous operations successfully blocked
- **Module Loading**: Community modules load and execute safely
- **Cline Integration**: Seamless communication between game and Cline

### Gameplay Experience Success

- **Narrative Immersion**: Player focuses on story, not technical implementation
- **Choice Meaningfulness**: Decisions impact both narrative and generated modules
- **Community Engagement**: Players create and share quality modules
- **Technical Quality**: Generated code meets professional standards
- **Progressive Complexity**: System grows organically through gameplay

## Development Readiness

### Prerequisites Met

- ✅ Complete technical architecture documented
- ✅ Security framework fully specified
- ✅ Module system design finalized

- ✅ All memory bank files updated with new architecture

### Current Implementation Status

Phase 1 is largely complete with a functional VSCode extension providing immersive cyberpunk gameplay. The basic game interface works perfectly, with all commands responding and narrative displaying directly in the game panel without popups.

**Next Priority**: Implement actual Cline integration so that game commands trigger real TypeScript module generation, bringing the core vision to life.

**Status**: TERMINAL INTERFACE COMPLETE - READY FOR CLINE AI INTEGRATION 🖥️✨

### Latest Major Update: Terminal Interface Transformation (Jan 9, 2025)

#### 🖥️ Terminal Features Implemented:

- **Sequential Command Flow**: Commands and responses display chronologically
- **Real Terminal Prompt**: Each command prefixed with ">" like authentic terminal
- **Full-Screen Layout**: Professional terminal spanning entire VSCode sidebar
- **Fixed Input Area**: Command input always at bottom with action buttons above
- **Auto-Scroll**: Terminal automatically scrolls to show latest content
- **Clean Styling**: Removed borders and frames for authentic terminal experience

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation Complete:

- **HTML Structure**: Updated to `terminal-content` architecture
- **CSS Classes**: All styling converted to terminal-specific layout
- **JavaScript Functions**: Complete rewrite of all functions:
  - `addNarrativeEntry()` → `addTerminalLine()`
  - `showCodeGeneration()` integrated with terminal
  - All event handlers work with new terminal structure
- **Message Flow**: Proper terminal-style command/response display

**Ready for Phase 2**: Interface is now a fully functional terminal ready for Cline AI integration.
