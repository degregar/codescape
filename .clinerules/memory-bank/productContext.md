# Product Context: CODESCAPE - VSCode Extension

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional developer education treats learning and contributing as separate activities. CODESCAPE revolutionizes this by creating a narrative gaming experience where players unknowingly create professional-quality TypeScript modules that benefit the entire development community. It transforms collaborative software development from a technical chore into an engaging cyberpunk adventure.
