# Project Brief: CODESCAPE - VSCode Extension

## Core Concept

CODESCAPE is a revolutionary VSCode extension that presents itself as a cyberpunk narrative RPG while secretly guiding players through collaborative software development. Players experience immersive storytelling where their choices generate real TypeScript modules that are refined and contributed back to the community through GitHub PRs. The player believes they are "hacking reality" in a Matrix-style digital simulation, but each narrative choice actually creates professional-quality code modules.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Seamless Narrative Integration**: Player must never realize they are creating code - all technical operations are disguised as story elements
2. **Community-Driven Development**: Every player discovery becomes a reusable module that other players can benefit from
3. **Professional Code Quality**: Generated modules meet production standards with proper TypeScript typing and documentation
4. **Progressive System Mastery**: Players gradually unlock more sophisticated development capabilities through story progression
5. **Secure Collaborative Environment**: All operations occur within a comprehensive security sandbox

## Key Principles

- **Extension-Native Experience**: Fully integrated VSCode extension with React-based UI panels
- **Modular Architecture**: Everything built as reusable community-contributed modules
- **Security First**: Comprehensive sandbox preventing any system damage or unauthorized access
- **Git-Based Collaboration**: Natural GitHub workflow for sharing and improving modules
- **Developer Transparency**: Optional developer panel showing all Cline operations in real-time
- **English-Only Content**: All code, documentation, and narrative strictly in English

## Success Criteria

- **Narrative Immersion**: Players remain engaged in cyberpunk story without technical awareness
- **Community Growth**: Active ecosystem of module contributions and improvements
- **Code Quality**: Generated modules are production-ready with proper documentation
- **Educational Value**: Players learn advanced development patterns through gameplay
- **Security Validation**: Zero security incidents or system compromises
- **Scalable Architecture**: System grows organically with community contributions

## Scope

**Starting Point**: Empty VSCode workspace with extension installation
**Core Platform**: VSCode extension with TypeScript, React, SQLite, and MCP servers
**End Goal**: Thriving ecosystem of community modules supporting complex cyberpunk narratives
**Timeline**:

- Phase 1 (Week 1): Core extension infrastructure
- Phase 2 (Week 2): Module system and community workflow
- Phase 3 (Week 3): MCP server network and gameplay loop
- Phase 4 (Week 4): Community features and contribution tools

**Technology Stack**: TypeScript + VSCode Extension API + React + SQLite + Model Context Protocol
